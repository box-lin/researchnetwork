# 1. Introduction

Explain the purpose for providing this design document. If this is a revision of an earlier document, please make sure to summarize what changes have been made during the revision (keep this discussion brief). 

Then provide a brief description of your project and state your project goal.

At the end of the introduction, provide an overview of the document outline.

Section II includes …

Section III includes …

# 2.	Architectural and Component-level Design
## 2.1 System Structure

This section should describe the high-level architecture of your software:  i.e., the major subsystems and how they fit together. 
If you adopted the application structure we used in the Smile App, your application would have the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. If you adopted a different architectural pattern, mention the pattern you adopted in your software and briefly discuss the rationale for using the proposed architecture (i.e., why that pattern fits well for your system).

In this section:
 * Provide a UML component diagram that illustrates the architecture of your software.
 * Briefly explain the role of each subsystem in your architectural design and explain the dependencies between them. 
 * Discuss the rationale for the proposed decomposition in terms of cohesion and coupling.

## 2.2 Subsystem Design 

(Note: This is just a suggested template. If you adopted a pattern other than MVC, you should revise this template and the list the major subsystems in your architectural design.)

### 2.2.1 Model

Briefly explain the role of the model.  

(***in iteration-1***) Include a list of the tables (models) in your database and explain the role of each table. Provide the attributes of the tables and briefly explain each attribute. 

(***in iteration -2***) Revise the database model. Provide a UML diagram of your database model showing the associations and relationships among tables. Your UML diagram should also show the methods of your models.

### 2.2.2 Controller

Briefly explain the role of the controller. If your controller is decomposed into smaller subsystems (similar to the Smile App design we discussed in class), list each of those subsystems as subsections. 

For each subsystem:
 * Explain the role of the subsystem (component) and its responsibilities.
 * 	Provide a detailed description of the subsystem interface, i.e., 
    * which other subsystems does it interact with?  
    * what are the interdependencies between them? 

**Note:** Some of your subsystems will interact with the Web clients (browsers). Make sure to include a detailed description of the  Web API interface (i.e. the set of routes) your application will implement. For each route specify its “methods”, “URL path”, and “a description of the operation it implements”.  
You can use the following table template to list your route specifications. 

(***in iteration-1***) Brainstorm with your team members and identify all routes you need to implement for the completed application and explain each route briefly. If you included most of the major routes but you missed only a few, it maybe still acceptable. 

(***in iteration-2***) Revise your route specifications, add the missing routes to your list, and update the routes you modified. Make sure to provide sufficient detail for each route. In iteration-2, you will be deducted points if you don’t include all major routes needed for implementing the required use-cases or if you haven’t described them in detail.

|   | Methods           | URL Path   | Description  |
|:--|:------------------|:-----------|:-------------|
|1. |                   |            |              |
|2. |                   |            |              |
|3. |                   |            |              |
|4. |                   |            |              |
|5. |                   |            |              |
|6. |                   |            |              |


### 2.2.3 View and User Interface Design 

Briefly explain the role of the view. Explain how you will build the user interfaces. Mention the frameworks or the libraries you plan to use.  

Provide a detailed description of user interface you have built so far. The information in this section should be accompanied with proper images of your screenshots.  Make sure to mention which use-cases in your “Requirements Specification” document will utilize these interfaces for user interaction. 


# 3. Progress Report

Write a short paragraph summarizing your progress in iteration1.

# 4. Testing Plan

(***in iteration 1***)
Don't include this section.

(***in iteration 2***)
In this section , provide a brief description of how you plan to test the system. Thought should be given to  mostly how automatic testing can be carried out, so as to maximize the limited number of human hours you will have for testing your system. Consider the following kinds of testing:
  * *Unit Testing*: Explain for what modules you plan to write unit tests, and what framework you plan to use.  (Each team should write automated tests (at least) for testing the API routes)
  * *Functional Testing*: How will you test your system to verify that the use cases are implemented correctly? (Manual tests are OK)
  * *UI Testing*: How do you plan to test the user interface?  (Manual tests are OK)



# 5. References

Cite your references here.

For the papers you cite give the authors, the title of the article, the journal name, journal volume number, date of publication and inclusive page numbers. Giving only the URL for the journal is not appropriate.

For the websites, give the title, author (if applicable) and the website URL.

# Appendix: Grading Rubric
(Please remove this part in your final submission)

These is the grading rubric that we will use to evaluate your document. 


|**MaxPoints**| **Design** |
|:---------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|           | Are all parts of the document in agreement with the product requirements? |
| 10        | Is the architecture of the system described well, with the major components and their interfaces?  Is the rationale for the proposed decomposition in terms of cohesion and coupling explained well? |
| 15        | Is the document making good use of semi-formal notation (i.e., UML diagrams)? Does the document provide a clear and complete UML component diagram illustrating the architecture of the system? |
| 15        | Is the model (i.e., “database model”) explained well with sufficient detail? | 
| 10        | Is the controller explained in sufficient detail?  |
| 20        | Are all major interfaces (i.e., the routes) listed? Are the routes explained in sufficient detail? |
| 10        | Is the view and the user interfaces explained well? Did the team provide the screenshots of the interfaces they built so far.   |
| 5         | Is there sufficient detail in the design to start Iteration 2?   |
| 5         | Progress report  |
|           |   |
|           | **Clarity** |
| 5         | Is the solution at a fairly consistent and appropriate level of detail? Is the solution clear enough to be turned over to an independent group for implementation and still be understood? |
| 5         | Is the document carefully written, without typos and grammatical errors?  |
|           |  |
