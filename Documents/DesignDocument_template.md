# 1. Introduction

The purpose of the Software Design Document is to provide a description of the design of a system fully enough to allow for software development to proceed with an understanding of what is to be built and how it is expected to built. The Software Design Document provides information necessary to provide description of the details for the software and system to be built.

The project is to built a platform for the students and the faculty mumbers in WSU. The Goal of this project is to provides smooth connections to research opportunities for students. professors or faculties can present their research opportunities on this platform. Students will be able to apply see all currently available research opportunities and be able to apply for them.

Overview of the document outlie: First, System Structure will talk about the major subsystem and how they fit together. Second, Subsystem design will talk about how are we going to design Model, Controller and View subsystems. Third, we will have a programm progress section, when we finish one iteration we will update the what did we finish in the iteration. This will help us keep in track of our project. Last, we will have a testing part for the document. We will planning how to test each iteration on this part.

Section II includes …

# 2.	Architectural and Component-level Design
## 2.1 System Structure

This section should describe the high-level architecture of your software:  i.e., the major subsystems and how they fit together. 
If you adopted the application structure we used in the Smile App, your application would have the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. If you adopted a different architectural pattern, mention the pattern you adopted in your software and briefly discuss the rationale for using the proposed architecture (i.e., why that pattern fits well for your system).

In this section:
 * Provide a UML component diagram that illustrates the architecture of your software.

 * Model: the model objects will contain the data and logic of the application .It have it own data but it should have no connection to the user. 

   View: the view objects display things on the screen and respond to user actions. 

   Controller: the controller objects connect the model objects and view objects. They supply the view objects with what they need to display and also provide the model with user input from the view.

 * cohesion represents the functional strength of modules and coupling represents the independence among modules. So our goal is to make the system have a strong functional strength and also make sure between each strong functional strength modules they have enough independence.

## 2.2 Subsystem Design 

(Note: This is just a suggested template. If you adopted a pattern other than MVC, you should revise this template and the list the major subsystems in your architectural design.)

### 2.2.1 Model

Briefly explain the role of the model.  

(***in iteration-1***) Include a list of the tables (models) in your database and explain the role of each table. Provide the attributes of the tables and briefly explain each attribute. 

(***in iteration -2***) Revise the database model. Provide a UML diagram of your database model showing the associations and relationships among tables. Your UML diagram should also show the methods of your models.

### 2.2.2 Controller

Briefly explain the role of the controller. If your controller is decomposed into smaller subsystems (similar to the Smile App design we discussed in class), ist each of those subsystems as subsections. 

For each subsystem:
 * Explain the role of the subsystem (component) and its responsibilities.
 * 	Provide a detailed description of the subsystem interface, i.e., 
    * which other subsystems does it interact with?  
    * what are the interdependencies between them?

**Note:** Some of your subsystems will interact with the Web clients (browsers). Make sure to include a detailed description of the  Web API interface (i.e. the set of routes) your application will implement. For each route specify its “methods”, “URL path”, and “a description of the operation it implements”.  
You can use the following table template to list your route specifications. 

(***in iteration-1***) Brainstorm with your team members and identify all routes you need to implement for the completed application and explain each route briefly. If you included most of the major routes but you missed only a few, it maybe still acceptable. 

(***in iteration-2***) Revise your route specifications, add the missing routes to your list, and update the routes you modified. Make sure to provide sufficient detail for each route. In iteration-2, you will be deducted points if you don’t include all major routes needed for implementing the required use-cases or if you haven’t described them in detail.

|      | Methods | URL Path | Description |
| :--- | :------ | :------- | :---------- |
| 1.   |         |          |             |
| 2.   |         |          |             |
| 3.   |         |          |             |
| 4.   |         |          |             |
| 5.   |         |          |             |
| 6.   |         |          |             |


### 2.2.3 View and User Interface Design 

Briefly explain the role of the view. Explain how you will build the user interfaces. Mention the frameworks or the libraries you plan to use.  

Provide a detailed description of user interface you have built so far. The information in this section should be accompanied with proper images of your screenshots.  Make sure to mention which use-cases in your “Requirements Specification” document will utilize these interfaces for user interaction. 


# 3. Progress Report

In iteration 1, we implement the basic features of the platform: create an account, log in, log out, post the research position, and delete the position post. The Users can create an account and assign it as Faculty or Student. The Student User can log into the student page and view all the posted research positions. The Faculty Users can log into the faculty page and post the research position by entering detailed descriptions. The research position posts can be deleted by the poster faculty user. 

# 4. Testing Plan

(***in iteration 1***)
Don't include this section.

(***in iteration 2***)
In this section , provide a brief description of how you plan to test the system. Thought should be given to  mostly how automatic testing can be carried out, so as to maximize the limited number of human hours you will have for testing your system. Consider the following kinds of testing:
  * *Unit Testing*: Explain for what modules you plan to write unit tests, and what framework you plan to use.  (Each team should write automated tests (at least) for testing the API routes)
  * *Functional Testing*: How will you test your system to verify that the use cases are implemented correctly? (Manual tests are OK)
  * *UI Testing*: How do you plan to test the user interface?  (Manual tests are OK)



# 5. References

Cite your references here.

For the papers you cite give the authors, the title of the article, the journal name, journal volume number, date of publication and inclusive page numbers. Giving only the URL for the journal is not appropriate.

For the websites, give the title, author (if applicable) and the website URL.
